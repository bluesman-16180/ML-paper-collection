[High bias]Large difference between bias and train error?
1. train bigger model
2. trian longer with better optimizaion algorithms
3. architecture/hyperparameters search

[High variance]Large difference between train and validation error?
1. more data
2. regularization to reduce overfitting
3. architecture/hyperparameter search
